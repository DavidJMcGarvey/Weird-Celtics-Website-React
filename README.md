#          Weird Celtics Website         #
------------------------------------------

I often find myself in pickle where I need a specific piece of dank Marcus Smart internet art but I have no one of simply search the vast gallery gems spread throughout the world of weird celtics twitter? 

## Application Description and Goals:

${What are the goals of this website?}
This website is meant to be a place where all the wonderful memes produced by the rad individuals apart of **Weird Celtics Twitter** (**#WCT**) can be searched for a shared. These rad individuals should be celebrated and their work should be credited predominantly throughout the website. Guests to the site should be able to explore the extensive collection or search to find something specific (probably **Smarf** related) and they should be able to easily find the rad individual responsible for any particualr piece and navigate to that rad individual's twitter handle (better yet, be able to follow FROM the SmarfGemDetail).

Celtics memes 
People who make memes get credit
Specifically Weird Celtics Twitter #WCT
